// You might see some C++ programs that runs without the standard namespace library. The using namespace std line can be omitted and replaced with the std keyword, followed by the :: operator for some objects:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!";      // cout object - operator used to output / print text
  return 0;
}
