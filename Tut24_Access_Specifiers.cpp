/*Access Specifier -

The public keyword is an access specifier. Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed. In the example above, the members are public - which means that they can be accessed and modified from outside the code.

In C++, there are three access specifiers:

public - members are accessible from outside the class
private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.

- If you try to access a private member, an error occurs.
- It is possible to access private members of a class using a public method inside the same class.
- By default, all members of a class are private if you don't specify an access specifier.

  myObj.y = 50;  // Not allowed (private) --- error occured here
